Basics
``````

When the ZTP process isn't behaving as expected, there are some basics that
should be checked regularly.

If the switch is not attempting Zero Touch Provisioning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Check whether ZTP has been disabled on the switch::

    Arista#show zerotouch

Validate the ZTP Server configuration syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many errors are simply due to typos or other syntax issues in config files. 
It is good practice to use the --validate option to ztps and to paste configs
in to `http://yamllint.com/` to ensure they are well-formed YAML::

    [user@ztpserver]$ ztps -â€“validate-config

Other troubleshooting steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A number of other troubleshooting steps including how to specify the separate 
apache log files just for ZTP Server, and how to do a test run of ztpserver
without reloading a switch are located on the :doc:`tips` page.

Before Requesting Support
`````````````````````````

Before emailing for assistance or opening a support case with Arista TAC,
please perform the following steps and collect the following data to enable
us to help in a timely manner.

Version and Install method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If not already recorded in the logs, please execute ``ztps --version`` and
specify whether your installation was from source (github), pip, RPM, or
a packer-ztpserver canned VM.

Server-side logs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The location of server-side logs may vary depending on your specific environment.

* If running ZTP Server via Apache, check the VirtualHost definition for 
  CustomLog and ErrorLog entries, otherwise, look in the default Apache logs.
  On Fedora, those will be in /var/log/httpd/
* If running the standalone ``ztps`` binary, a good choice for debugging, please
  include the ``--debug`` option.  Using ``ztps --debug 2>&1 | tee ztpserver.log`` will log
  the output to both the screen and a file.

Client-side logs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ensure the bootstrap client is configured to log to syslog or XMPP via
/usr/share/ztpserver/bootstrap/bootstrap.conf and include that output.

Configuration Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please, also, include the files in /etc/ztpserver/ and /usr/share/ztpserver/
directories.   ``tar czvf my_ztpserver_config.tgz /etc/ztpserver/ /usr/share/ztpserver/``
